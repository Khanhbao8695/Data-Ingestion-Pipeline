#DG-Week-6
Validation of the schema and the ingestion of files in data pipelining is an important component of data engineering; 
We need to know how to read data in the most efficient way possible to maximize resource utilization. 
This project will be used to demonstrate different approaches of reading data and determining the best way to do so. After that, try validating input data using a YAML file and, if the file is correct, writing it to a.gz file.
